# OpenFS Core (prototype)

Prototype shared filesystem mapper.

Work-in-progress; don't use

## Scratchpad

- r/w permissions
- valid filenames / directory names
- inode objects
- url -> filename conversion
- change callbacks
- retrieval callbacks -> content not stored in fs itself
- core should run in all JS environments

### Node.js specific ideas (incl. + Electron)
